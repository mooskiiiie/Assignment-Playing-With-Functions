The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, 12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

Write a function that allows a self-service Point of Sale system to give you the exact change when you pay in cash.

The function should accept the number of cents entered by the caller of the function. It then should display the denominations of the coins that should be given to the buyer. The change should use as few coins as possible. Assume that the Point of Sale system is loaded with 1 cent, 5 cents, 10 cents, 25 cents and 1 peso coins.

Write main program code that accepts the number of cents manually through user input and calls the function written above.

Input: The program accepts one positive integer, cents, corresponding to the total change to be given by the Point of Sale system.

Output: The number of 1 peso, 25 cents, 10 cents, 5 cents and 1 cent coins respectively. There should be one output per line.
